<h1>Fibonacci Sequence</h1>
<p>
From Wikipedia:
</p>
<p>
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Often, especially in modern usage, the sequence is extended by one more initial term:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The Fibonacci sequence appears in Indian mathematics, in connection with Sanskrit prosody. In the Sanskrit tradition of prosody, there was interest in enumerating all patterns of long (L) syllables that are 2 units of duration, and short (S) syllables that are 1 unit of duration. Counting the different patterns of L and S of a given duration results in the Fibonacci numbers: the number of patterns that are m short syllables long is the Fibonacci number <i>F</i><sub>m + 1</sub>.
