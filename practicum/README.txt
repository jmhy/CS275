Practicum - By Joseph Haggerty

Part 1 requires jmh463_part1.html, part1.js, and jQuery, which are included with the practicum files. To use part 1, open the aforementioned html file in a web browser, choose the route # from the dropdown, and click "Load Schedule."

Part 2 requires part2.js and Node.js installed. To get Part 1 displayed, type in the URL "localhost:8080/part1". To use part 2, type in the URL "http://localhost:8080/part2?message=hello&count=4" to get a response that repeats the "message" by "count" times. For the example, hello is repeated 4 times.

All files should be kept in the same folder/directory.
